Below is a reference of available buttons for assignment (following standard XInput/Virtual-Key definitions, but slightly extended)
You absolutely *must* assign them with strings and not in any other way (e.g. decimal/hex numbers).

For each event you may assign only 1 button.

Inline comments are NOT allowed in the configuration file for string reads! So this includes all button assignments!

=== BASICS ===

Format is as follows:

[Events]
EVENT = BUTTON_NAME
...

[EventsKB]
EVENT = KEYBOARD_KEY_NAME
...

=== XINPUT ===

It should be pretty self-explanatory.

XINPUT_GAMEPAD_DPAD_UP

=== KEYBOARD ===

Keyboard assignments should follow the Virtual-Key Code definitions (you can find them here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes)
Type their definition names in directly (e.g. if you want to assign the Return key, just use VK_RETURN directly in the config file)
For single letter assignments, type the letter in as-is (e.g. if you want to assign the 'G' key, just use G)

=== Event list ===

Below is a full list of available events in the game which you may assign. 
They trigger at various points in the game (whenever their handlers are generated), but not all of them actually work.
Reminder that some events are assigned only to the SECOND controller, such as debug camera actions.

NOTE: quitting with Q key is hardcoded due to the way it's coded in the game
